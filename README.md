### 👋 Hi, I'm Tung!

I'm a 4th-year Computer Engineering student at UBC with a strong passion for building scalable backend systems, intuitive user interfaces, and AI-powered applications.

I have 1 year of professional experience as a Python Test Engineer, where I worked on automation frameworks, CI/CD pipelines, and performance testing in Dockerized and cloud environments (AWS).

I love combining engineering and creativity to design reliable systems that make a real impact — whether it’s through distributed architectures, clean UI design, or intelligent automation.
